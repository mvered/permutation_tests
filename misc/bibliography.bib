Alternative hypotheses assuming additive treatment effects are considered. It is shown that the critical value of the test statistic tends to a constant in probability as the number of blocks becomes large. The large-sample power of the test is calculated for a sequence of alternatives arising naturally from the randomization model.},

Defining a natural measure of dependence \$D(f)\$ as the squared \$L{\textasciicircum}2\$-distance between a joint density \$f\$ and the product of its marginals, we first show that there is no valid test of independence that is uniformly consistent against alternatives of the form \${\textbackslash}\{f: D(f) {\textbackslash}geq {\textbackslash}rho{\textasciicircum}2 {\textbackslash}\}\$. We therefore restrict attention to alternatives that impose additional Sobolev-type smoothness constraints, and define a permutation test based on a basis expansion and a \$U\$-statistic estimator of \$D(f)\$ that we prove is minimax optimal in terms of its separation rates in many instances. Finally, for the case of a Fourier basis on \$[0,1]{\textasciicircum}2\$, we provide an approximation to the power function that offers several additional insights. Our methodology is implemented in the R package {USP}.},

	abstract = {Resampling methods are frequently used in practice to adjust critical values of nonparametric tests. In the present paper a comprehensive and unified approach for the conditional and unconditional analysis of linear resampling statistics is presented. Under fairly mild assumptions we prove tightness and an asymptotic series representation for their weak accumulation points. From this series it becomes clear which part of the resampling statistic is responsible for asymptotic normality. The results leads to a discussion of the asymptotic correctness of resampling methods as well as their applications in testing hypotheses. They are conditionally correct iff a central limit theorem holds for the original test statistic. We prove unconditional correctness iff the central limit theorem holds or when symmetric random variables are resampled by a scheme of asymptotically random signs. Special cases are the m (n) out of k (n) bootstrap, the weighted bootstrap, the wild bootstrap and all kinds of permutation statistics. The program is carried out for convergent partial sums of rowwise independent infinitesimal triangular arrays in detail. These results are used to compare power functions of conditional resampling tests and their unconditional counterparts. The proof uses the method of random scores for permutation type statistics.},

In this survey we review some recently developed methods for testing hypotheses about high-dimensional multinomials. Traditional tests like the \${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$-test and the likelihood ratio test can have poor power in the high-dimensional setting. Much of the research in this area has focused on finding tests with asymptotically normal limits and developing (stringent) conditions under which tests have normal limits. We argue that this perspective suffers from a significant deficiency: it can exclude many high-dimensional cases when—despite having non-normal null distributions—carefully designed tests can have high power. Finally, we illustrate that taking a minimax perspective and considering refinements of this perspective can lead naturally to powerful and practical tests.},

	abstract = {Permutation tests are widely used in statistics, providing a finite-sample guarantee on the type I error rate whenever the distribution of the samples under the null hypothesis is invariant to some rearrangement. Despite its increasing popularity and empirical success, theoretical properties of the permutation test, especially its power, have not been fully explored beyond simple cases. In this paper, we attempt to partly fill this gap by presenting a general nonasymptotic framework for analyzing the minimax power of the permutation test. The utility of our proposed framework is illustrated in the context of two-sample and independence testing under both discrete and continuous settings. In each setting, we introduce permutation tests based on U-statistics and study their minimax performance. We also develop exponential concentration bounds for permuted U-statistics based on a novel coupling idea, which may be of independent interest. Building on these exponential bounds, we introduce permutation tests, which are adaptive to unknown smoothness parameters without losing much power. The proposed framework is further illustrated using more sophisticated test statistics including weighted U-statistics for multinomial testing and Gaussian kernel-based statistics for density testing. Finally, we provide some simulation results that further justify the permutation approach.},
