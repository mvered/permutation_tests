# permutation tests 

## about this project
Simulations to understand the performance (probability of Type I and Type II errors) for permutation-based U-statistics, focusing on small sample sizes

## simulations
-  Two-sample test of centerr, comparing Mann-Whitney U-test with p-value obtained from a normal approximation for the distribution of the U-statistic versus a Mann-Whitney U-test with a p-value drawn from a permutation distribution
-  Independence testing for two categorical variables, comparing a Chi-squared test with a standard p-value, a Chi-squared test with a bootstrapped p-value, and a multinomial U-statistic proposed by Kim et. al. 2022 with p-values obtained from a permutation distribution
